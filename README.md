## Assets

Image assets should all be in [webp format](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/). You can convert webp images like [with the `cwebp` tool like so](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp):

```bash
# Convert a single file(PNG in this example) to webp
cwebp -q $QUALITY $FILE -resize $NEWX $NEWY -crop $X $Y $XOFFSET $YOFFSET -o ./$(basename $FILE .png).webp

#Convert a directory of png files to webp
for file in ./$DIR/*; do
    [ -f "$file" ] || continue
    cwebp -q 60 "$file" -resize $NEWX $NEWY -crop $X $Y $XOFFSET $YOFFSET-o ./$OUTDIR/$(basename "$file" .png).webp
done
```
